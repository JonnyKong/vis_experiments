# Meningitis

### Experiment 1: does Tableau Query Monitor and SQL Server logs record the same set of queries?

### Experiment 2: generate individual SQL queries for 4 types of operations:

1. Applying filters: toggle *H influenzae type B meningiti*s off and on, then toggle 1 to 4 off and on.

   Note: the baseline setting is cached, so no queries have been recorded when filters are toggled back on.

2. Changing the year: start from "*All*", change year to *2014*, *2015*, *2016*, and *2017* respectively

   Note: the baseline setting "*All*" is cached

3. Hovering over countries: hover over Greenland, Canada, U.S., and Mexico

4. ~~Selecting a country~~ (This is identical to step 3)

### Experiment 3: generate a workload from the above queries

### Experiment 4: adopt suggested queries and observe performance
